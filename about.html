                    <h1>YOU'VE BEEN SCAMMED</h1>
                    <p>Congratulations! You've just fallen victim to the most sophisticated dental scam of the century. Your toothbrush is now smarter than you, and it's plotting to take over your life, one brushstroke at a time.</p>
                    <p>But please, start paying attention to such companies in the future. Innovation doesn't always mean progress.</p>
                    <p>We address our project to companies and projects that claim to be innovative but, in reality, do not contribute meaningful progress to society. Many startups or tech ventures focus on flashy, "advanced" solutions that sound impressive but are ultimately trivial or unnecessary. Our project highlights this phenomenon by satirizing such companies, using a fictional AI-connected toothbrush with useless features as an example.</p>
                    <p style="text-align : center;"> Is innovation always useful ?</p>
                    <p style ="text-align : center;"> What are the differences between progress and innovation ? </p>
                    <p> We encourage you to reflect on these questions and consider the true impact of technological advancements in your own life and society.</p>

                    <p> Please share the project to your friends or family.</p>
